# Parse-Input-Files
This program parses input string files delimited by a comma, pipe, or spaces.

This program can be tested here: https://repl.it/Cev5/46

This was a bonus challenge problem assigned during the Fullstack Academy Bootcamp Prep course. It has three types of string inputs, with different delimiters: a pipe (‘|’), a comma, or a space. The aim of the program is to parse, sort, and alter the strings according to specific instructions.
